### About Me

My name is Ingrid Fan and I am an undergraduate senior at Stanford University studying Symbolic Systems with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. I'm especially passionate about the intersection of human psychology and technology, which has thus led me to interesting opportunities in marketing technologies and UI/UX. 

In my free time, I am an amateur photographer, singer, and a self-declared comedian. 

Useless talents include but are not limited to:
